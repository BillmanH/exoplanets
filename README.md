# exoplanets
side project for exploring exoplanet data


## Dataset
Planet Data is gathered from here. 
### Important Links
* [Dataset column definitions](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DocSet/index.html?doctree=/docs/docmenu.xml&startdoc=item_1_01)
* [Data from this table](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS)

* uploading that data to cosmos (once parsed) with `python scripts/upload_systems.py`

### Database (Cosmos DB)
The connection info is in the `configure.yaml` and looks like this. It is in `.gitignore` so you will need to add that file. 
```
 # Web location of the cosmos DB:
endpoint: wss://<the domain of your instance>:443/

# Login Info:
username: /dbs/<dbname>/colls/<coll name>
password: <Password string from the azure portal>
```
You can test your connection with `python scripts/test_connection.py`.


## App
Running the web app from the root directory. 
```
python web/manage.py runserver
```
`models.py` has two functions, one that takes a request, and another that runs a query. `run_query` takes the query text string as an imput, with a default of `"g.V().count()"`
