The game is now in **OPEN BETA** Meaning I've still got a long way to go, but the game is playable enough where I can start opening it up to users. [How to create an account](docs/creating_a_new_account.md)

# What is left to do, and when to do it:
The `dev` branch has the more current workload. Unless I get too busy with other things I'll pull those changes into `main` every month. 


## December
* Patron Account
* Production Environment
* Delete game / new game improvements

## **BETA - RELEASE** - Should be playable, but will still have a lot to go.

## January
* Government choices
* Faction settings
* Conflict
* Rebellion
* War
* Terrorism
* Peace
* Planetary observation

## Hopefull things to implement in 2025
* Megastructures
* Technology development
* More complicated race and generation process
* More Biomes
* More statistical reporting for later game managment





Exoplanets is a real-time, multi-player, online game where you manage a civilization and its people. Starting at the moment where your technology makes it possible to launch an individual into outer space, you must make choices that guide your people on its journey to the stars.

At the start of the game, your civilization is growing rapidly. It is also consuming organic resources at a rate faster than the planet can restore. In time the resources will diminish and your people will starve and die. Your goal is to build infrastructure and technology to stabilize this.

The game is a simulation platform first, with some interaction that influences the running simulation. Your civilization is growing, consuming resources, fighting wars without your interaction. Your goal is to nudge them into a sustainable future.

The game is about simulation, systems-thinking and collective progress. The only adversary is the erosion of your own cosmic destiny.

## Making your own game
I built this game so that I could clone it and create different versions. You should be able to clone the repo and run it on your own machine or in the cloud of your choice. Some assembly is required as this application uses a lot of tools. I'm working to keep the costs of the game down to ~$20 a month.

Of course, you can also just clone it on your local machine and run for free. Feel free to create an issue and I'll address them as I'm able.

| The graph has lots of core elements that need to be set up for the game to function. All of that is in the notebooks. |

# Contributing
I designed this game as a good project for a junior developer. This might be a bit much if you've never done any programming at all, but if you know basic data transformations and logic then this game should be a good project for you. [Feel free to reach out](mailto:william.jeffrey.harding@gmail.com) or just fork the `dev` branch and make a PR. I'll test everything in `dev` before pulling it into the website, so any PRs should go to the `dev` or new `feature` branch.  

Pretty early in the design right now as I have a lot to do before I have a legit game. Also feel free to make suggestions in the `issues`. I'm so early in this concept that there are lots of design decisions remaining. 

Make sure to update the `environment.yaml` if you add python packages:
```
conda env export --name exoplanets --from-history > environment.yaml
```
