# How to create a new account.

Account management is all through [Azure Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id). I don't manage any of it. 

## Steps to log in

### when you go to start a new game or continue a game, it will check your credentials. If you don't have them, it will send you to the sign-in page.

### When you try to log in, it will trigger the MSAuth page.

If you get this error, it is because I have not yet added you to the Active Directory Group that will grant you access. You will need to request accesss. 

### Use the request access link to create the email form and submit it.

### Submit that form and I will add you to the group. Once approved you should be able to log in. 

I'll have a legit form at some point. But for right now I'm keeping the infrastructure light. This enables users to play the game and create accounts.
