# Azure Function Management. 

A critical part of the infrastructure is the event-driven architecture that facilitates the simulation.  



## Creating the funciton environmnet locally
1. Make sure you have the right [VSC components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators), including the functions CLI tool. 
2. [Initialize Azure functions locally](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-python). 
    * `func init az-functions --worker-runtime python --model V2`
    
## Notes on creating a new function. 
Under my event driven architecture, most of the functions created will be triggered by the event hub. Generally, events will be generated by the `engine.py` in the root directory. For this reason, you should be able to test your function by running `engine.py` locally. 
1. Navigate to the `az-functions` folder of the project. 
2. `func new --template "Azure Event Hub" --name verb-object` note the `verb-object` naming convention.


### Side notes on the AZ function CLI tools
* You can use `func templates list` to get a list of the function templates.
